Welcome to molecular simulations and force field development lab at IIT-Gandhinagar

You are expected to read the Documentation regardingg the Machines and Softwares available in the Lab.

## Softwares Available in Lab

The availability of the softwares will vary depending on the machine that you are alloted. You are expected to be able to compile the softwares required from source (PhD students). MSc Project Students will not be provided with administrator privilages, and should always contact a PhD student to install required softwares.

We have SSH enabled in all the machines in the lab. You are required to contact Sairam Sir for the account credentials and IP addresses of the machines.
